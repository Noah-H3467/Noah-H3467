***About me***

I am a high school student greatly inspired by the applications of electrical engineering, computer science, and robotics.


-  <-- Look to the left: Get Rick Rolled by my Desmos Graphing Calculator graph!
-  I've worked on features for	[my FIRST Robotics team's codebase](https://github.com/WHS-FRC-3467/W8-Library)
-  I'm currently working on a project - the 'Advanced Design Challenge' for my Engineering Capstone class. The 'analyzer' portion will contain a standard USB (5VDC, 0.5A) external power access, a visible blinking red LED when powered, and a visible, solid, color-matched LED and audible buzzer notification when a payload is identified.
-  Here's [a look](https://noah-h3467.github.io/Noah-Haskell-s-Personal-Portfolio/) at some of the projects I've worked on - both independently and as a part of a  team.
